## Intoduction 

**Cross Document Coreference (CDC)**  is the task of clustering words and names - across multiple documents, that refer to the same concept, entity or event. CDC is an important natural language processing task for downstream applications such as abstractive summarization, question & answering, and information extraction.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*DqTwuASwM-JUgBoN)

To ensure quality when crowdsourcing Cross Document Coreference, an annotator must be trained to understand the nuances of co-reference and then be provided with all the information needed to accurately make coreference cluster assignments for every mention in a topic. The quality of an annotator's work must then be reviewable by a designated reviewer.

## Features

This tool provides capabilites for the full end to end process for CDC Annotation consisting of:
![E2E Process](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PkVBeqteVqxfljbqSY1qww.png)

### 1. Onboarding

A trainee is provided with a sequence of mentions. For each mention the trainee decides whether to update the mention‚Äôs span and then to either create a new mention or assign the mention to an existing cluster.  At any point of time, the trainee may view the mentions in any existing cluster. If the trainee incorrectly changes a mention span or assigns a mention to the wrong cluster they will be notified. Additionally after certain decisions an explanation of a specific important rule of co-reference will be explained. Once all mentions are clustered the annotator can submit the job.

#### Configuration
A sample configuration json file for onboarding can be found here for more information on tool configuration see the configuration section.


### 2. Annotation 

The annotator is provided with a sequence of mentions. For each mention the annotator decides whether to update the mention‚Äôs span and then to either create a new mention or assign the mention to an existing cluster.  At any point in time the annotator can re-assign a previously assigned mention to another cluster or view the mentions in an existing cluster. Once all mentions are clustered the annotator can submit the job.

#### Configuration
A sample configuration json file for annotation can be found here for more information on tool configuration see the configuration section.

### 3. Reviewing 

The Reviewer is provided a sequential list of mentions as well as a highlighted list of clusters that the reviewer may have meant to assign them to. For each mention the reviewer is shown the potential clusters that the annotator believed the mention belongs to. The reviewer then  decides whether to update the mention‚Äôs span and then whether to agree or update the annotators assignment.
